*Investment Products for Asset Allocation:*

*Broker vs. Fiduciary:*

* Broker: basically a salesperson just has to provide you with a product that is suitable it doesn’t matter who benefits more.
* Fiduciary - Legally have to remove an potential conflicts of interest or at a minimum disclose them and put the clients need before their own.

*Failure of Mutual Funds:*

1. 96% of actively managed mutual funds fail to beat the market over any sustainable amount of time.
    * Only place this doesn’t quite hold true is emerging markets.
2. Four and five star funds of the 248 five-star rating only 4 kept that rating after 10yrs.
3. High fee’s normally pay 3,000% more fee’s for inferior performance.  Fee’s work the same way as compounding interest 1% vs. 3% can be about a factor of 2x for 100,000 with a growing rate of 7%.
4. Breaks down each of the fee’s you can expect to see with mutual funds most of which they don’t have to disclose.
5. Returns are time-weighted (from day 1) so doesn’t correctly report returns.

*6 Human Needs:*

1. Certainty/Comfort:
    * Need to feel in control and to know whats coming next so we can feel secure.
    * The higher the need for certainty the less risk you’ll be willing to bear.
2. Uncertainty/Variety:
    * Need change in your life its hard to grow if you have nothing to push back against.
3. Significance:
    * Our need to feel special, unique, or needed.
    * Spending a lot of money can make you feel significant, and so can spending very little
4. Love and Connection:
    * Love is the oxygen of life
    * The 1st 4 need are need of the personality
5. Growth

2 people invest:

1. 80,000 (4,000/yr. x 20yrs. @ 10%) started @ 20
2. 100,000 (4,000/yr. x 25yrs. @ 10%) started @ 40

Person 1 would make 600% more than person 2

*Cool Story:*

* When Ben Franklin died in 1790 he left $1,000 to Boston and Philadelphia.  With strings attached specifically the money was to be invested and not touched for 100 yrs.  At that point each city could withdraw up to 500,000 for designated public works projects any remaining money could not be touched for another 100 yrs. Finally 200 yrs. after Franklin’s death in 1990 amounted to approx. 6.5 million
