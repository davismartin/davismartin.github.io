### Lake Tahoe

For those of you who haven't gone to Lake Tahoe I highly recommend it.  It has a rare mix of relaxation, great outdoor activities, and gambling for those who are into it.  Last year I even won some money gambling during the super bowl.  Here is a short list of what I would checkout if I were going.

## *1. Emerald Bay*
