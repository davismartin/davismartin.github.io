summary: The packages I use for my editor of choice
---
The Atom editor from Github is my editor of choice.  Below are the packages I currently use and why I currently use them.  Note: I try to keep my packages to a minimum that way:

1. I am not totally lost when using someone else's computer or setting up a new dev environment.
2. Personally I can sink an amazing amount of time into looking up new packages to try and improve my current setup taking me away from dev time.

Though now I am looking to create some kind of optimum atom setup so that we can quickly get new devs spun up at work that use Atom.

Packages:

1. [platformio-ide-terminal](https://atom.io/packages/platformio-ide-terminal)
* I use this to make Atom more like an IDE to run things like webpack and npm.

2. [emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet)
* The main reason I use this is so I can type `div.xs-col-12` and get `<div class="xs-col-12"></div>`

3. [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)
* Awesome for picking out colors or creating new ones with things like the `lighten` function

4. [tabs-to-spaces](https://atom.io/packages/tabs-to-spaces)
* Helps with formatting and like the name says toggling between tabs and spaces

5. [pretty-json](https://atom.io/packages/pretty-json)
* Crucial for quickly formatting JSON.
